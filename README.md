## Recommender Systems with Python

This notebook will focus on providing a basic recommendation system by suggesting items that are most similar to a particular item, in this case, movies. This is not a true robust recommendation system, it just tells you what movies/items are most similar to your movie choice.

Recommender systems can be broadly categorized into two main types: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.

## Content-Based Filtering:
Content-based filtering recommends items to a user based on the features of items they have shown interest in before. In other words, it recommends items similar to those a user has liked in the past.

## Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative filtering recommends items based on the behavior of users and their interactions with items. There are two main types of collaborative filtering: User-User and Item-Item.
